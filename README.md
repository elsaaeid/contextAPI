<h1>React Context</h1>
<p>React Context is a feature in React that allows you to manage global application state and share data between components without the need for prop drilling. It provides a way to pass data down the component tree without explicitly passing it through each intermediate component.</p>

<h2>How React Context Works:</h2>

<p>React Context consists of two main components: the Provider and the Consumer. The Provider component is used to wrap the components that need access to the shared data. It accepts a <strong>value prop</strong>, which can be any JavaScript value or an object containing multiple values. The Consumer component is used to consume the data provided by the Provider.</p>
